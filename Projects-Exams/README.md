# Projects and Exams

## Binary Black Holes 

The directory contains an analysis on Binary Objects properties - Binary Black Holes, Binary Neutron Stars, Binary Black Hole - Neutron Star. 
The simulation of the dataset using an undisclosed tool was a huge part of the project.
Only analysis notebooks and results are shown. 

## Call Center Simulations

Analysis of calls from a Call Center using R. The project contained also simulations using JAGS and Bayesian Networks (BNlearn) - Private project. 

## CosmicRays LiveDashboard

This directory contains the scripts that run a live dashboard for a DAQ sending 1kHz input raw data from cosmic rays detectors. 
The tools used are in this case Apache Kafka for streaming and Apache Spark for processing. Stable applications have been developed using 5 VMs on a remote cluster, managing to tolerate input rates up to 3kHz. 

## CosmicRays NuclearMeasurement

The second directory contains the analysis done in a C++/ROOT environment for the Radioactivity and Nuclear Measurement course. Data have been collected focusing only on cosmic rays with the Garfield apparatus in Legnaro(PD) during a campaign in january 2021. The main goal of the analysis was the characterization of the detector to natural radiation.

## Data Management
The data manegement repository contains a fun notebook, where some exercises on redundancy for safe storage (RAIDx), cryptography and blockchains are proposed. 

## Fir Filter + FPGA4Trading

In this directory there are a report on the VHDL script implementing a FIR filter, and a pdf presentation on the usage of FPGAs for high frequency trading. 

## Muon Source Simulation

The directory contains a simulation of the properties of a muon beam coming from a primary reactions. 
Simulations are in this case run from scratch, ranging from the base cross section calculations to the beam's properties.

## Nuclear Physics

In this directory are presented the data collected simulating the characteristics of the band structure of 48V, a nucleus presenting peculiar properties. The code used for the simulations was kShell, based on the Nuclear Shell Model. Moreover, a presentation on Coulomb Excitation at intermediate energies is present. 

## Theoretical Physics

Pdf containing the results of a quite complicated exam proposed at the end of the Theoretical Physics course, focused mainly on QED.

## tSNE and DBSCAN 

Final report containing in a ordered way the results obtained in an exercise done for the LCP_modB course (See Exercise04.ipynb for source code).
